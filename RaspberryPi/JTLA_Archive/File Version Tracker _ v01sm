JTLA_SingleMotor_control_voxsm:
	These scripts were used to gain a deeper understanding of how the variousaspects of the control
	system work, and to experiment with features/functions before implementing them into the main
	control algorithm

	v03sm:
		-Allows user to increase/decrease motor position
		-Includes an ABORT button to exit closed loop control
		-Includes a button to clear any active errors on controller
		-Uses color stylings on pushbuttons and slider

	v04sm:
		-Experimenting with assigning motor parameters through Can

JTLA_FullControl_v0xsm:
	These scripts follow the development of the control algorithm used for the traveling JTLA unit.
	These were generated in preparation for handing the travel unit over, and provide full
	functionality of the JTLA.

	v11sm:
		-Full actuator functionality (live plots commmanded/actual pos, manual & sine behaviors)

	v12sm:
		-Same as v11sm but tries to implement error reading and handling (not working)

	v13sm:
		-Save-as from v11sm, not v12sm
		-Implemented function to exit closed loop control (reference methodology used in
		 	JTLA_SingleMotor_control_vo4sm)
		-Implemented button/slider styling (reference JTLA_SingleMotor_control_vo4sm)

	v14sm:
		-Implemented LVDT outputs (IN WORK but not working yet)

	v15sm:
		-Save-as from v13sm
		-Added another push button to record data and export to CSV
		-Added safety check to exit closed loop (3x) if tip travel limit is exceeded

	v16sm: 
		-Save as from v15sm
		-Added LVDT reading functionality!
			-Global function to read LVDT voltage
			-Timer in ControlPanel class to call function
			-Exits closed loop control if voltage exceeds limit
			-Need to update to read position, not voltage
			-Also need update to fully abort rest of program

	v17sm: (IN WORK)
		-Save as from v16sm
		-Added LVDT scaling and offset
		-Added motor 3 counter-retract during motor 1 homing
